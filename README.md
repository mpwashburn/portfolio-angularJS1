# Personal Website & Portfolio for Michael Washburn
<p>This website is being recoded from the Wordpress custom theme portfolio_v1 located in my repository. The purpose is to begin applying my AngularJS 1 skills, as well as advancing them. This recoding comes after completing Code School's courses "Shaping up With AngularJS", and "Staying Sharp with AngularJS".</p>

###Phase One:
<p>In phase one I am cutting and pasting the majority of the code from the custom Wordpress theme into my Angular personal site. Rather than a multi-page layout, it will be a Single Page Application<p>
